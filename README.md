**Concept of the Project:**

The Food Rescue Connect is a platform designed to combat hunger and food insecurity by connecting surplus food from businesses, restaurants, and households with individuals and communities in need. By providing a centralized space to match excess food with those who need it, the project aims to reduce food waste, support food banks and other non-profit organizations, and create a collaborative network dedicated to addressing hunger. With features like food donation listings, recipient registration, real-time inventory tracking, and volunteer coordination, The Food Rescue Connect strives to make the distribution of surplus food efficient, accessible, and impactful.


**Problem Statement:**

Despite the abundance of food produced, millions of people still suffer from hunger and food insecurity. A significant portion of food is wasted due to the lack of a centralized platform that efficiently connects food donors with recipients. Addressing this challenge requires the development of the Food Rescue Connect, a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between surplus food sources and those in need.
